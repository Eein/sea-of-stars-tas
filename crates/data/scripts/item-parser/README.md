# Item Parser

- Copy extracted inventory json files into `./input`
- Copy extracted locale files into `./locale` - the name of the files can be found in the script
- run `node item-parser.js`

If everything was set correctly, it will output an `output.rs` file that should be ready to copy into the project.
